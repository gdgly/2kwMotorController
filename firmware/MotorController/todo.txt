Encoder driver

Current sensor

Test sensors over wider range
- Plot about 10 different values (ref. to multimeter)


UART command interface
- text based
- basic closed-loop commands


Simple velocity controller
- Saturate current (maybe simple kv, rm model)


Improve PWM driver

H-bridge safety functions




TODO: bugfixes
* panic_log_msg doesn't always work
* sensor_task_code is shit
