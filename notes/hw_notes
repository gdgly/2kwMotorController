BLEEDER RESISTOR POWER REQUIREMENTS
Assumption: Vgen ~= 40V (10,000 RPM on E30-400)
* Max regenerative current is about 80A

GATE DRIVER POWER REQUIREMENTS
* 10-12V drive voltage is desired
* Each driver consumes about 25mA max when switching at 20 kHz
* Total power consumption is about 12*.025*2 = 0.60 W

SECONDARY POWER SUPPLY
* Run the fan, gate drivers, sensors, MCU, etc, from a 12V battery
* Total power draw should be less than 500 mA (6W)
* Will need step-down to 3.3V and possibly 5V as well for digital stuff

SENSOR CIRCUITS
All sensors must be isolated!
* Current sensor
* Temperature sensor (x2) [Motor, Heatsink]
* Voltage sensor (x2) [Battery, VBus]

COMMUNICATION CIRCUITS
* CAN bus
* Ethernet port
* Debug UART


=======================


HIGH-CURRENT CONDUCTORS
* First prototype can use wide traces with extra solder:
 At 5mm width, 2oz/ft^2 cu, 20A causes 30C rise
* Later versions can use custom-milled busbar soldered to component leads
 5mm x 2mm copper bar provides plenty of current capacity

CURRENT SENSOR: LAH-100 [Closed-loop Hall Effect]
* 2000:1 stepdown transformer, outputs 50mA secondary at 100A primary
* Runs on +/-12 to +/-15V supply; 10 - 60 mA consumed @ +/-15V
* 160A input max
* 0.25% accuracy
* W,L,H = (15, 33, 21)mm

ADC INPUT SIGNAL PROTECTION
* Feed ADC from op amp operating on same 3.3V supply

ADC INPUT SIGNAL CONDITIONING
* Simple level shifter with 1 op amp, 2 resistors
* Low pass (antialiasing filters) will be needed
* 20 kHz PWM frequency -> 200+ kHz bandwidth desired

HEATSINK
* Delta LGA heatsink with Cu base and Al fin structure (70, 106, 25.5)mm
* Screw / spring assembly on Cu base will pull heatsink down onto PCB
* TO-247 MOSFETs mounted flush against bottom of PCB, leads bent right angle
* Insulating pad (silicone, etc) between each FET and the heatsink
* TO-247 thickness ~= 5mm (space between PCB and heatsink
  Space between leads and heatsink ~= 2.4mm
  Leads must be bent >= 4.29mm away from case
  Minimum bend radius mustbe 0.5mm

PCB Quote
Assuming 70 x 150mm size, 4 layers, 1oz/ft^2, 6mil trace
Easy EDA: $40.22 for 5 boards, + $7.30 [1-3 weeks] or + $28.80 [3-4 days] (+3-4 days)

SECONDARY SUPPLY BUDGET
* 12V DC Fan: 2W
* Current sensor: 10 - 60 mA @ 12V = 120 - 720 mW
* Gate drivers: 10V, ~20 mA = 200 mW
* Optocouplers: 10V->5V, ~20 mA = 200 mW
* MCU: 130 mA @ 3.3V MAX = 430 mW
* Misc [LEDs, op amps, etc] ~100 mW? 
RAW TOTAL: P ~= 3.8 W
Assuming 80% converter efficiency, P ~= 3.6/0.8 = 4.75W

+12 rail max: ~270 mA / 3.2 W
-12 rail max: ~100 mA / 0.9 W
3.3 rail max: ~200 mA / 660 mW

9V SECONDARY BATTERY SPECS
P = 3.75W -> I = 415 mA
6 cells at 1.5V nominal: usable until cells hit ~0.9V (5.4V total)



ALTERNATE SECONDARY SUPPLY IDEA:
* High voltage buck converter on motor battery to power gate drive, fan, optos, etc
* ... still need to generate +/-12V for current sensor. Which means LT3471 or similar.




VOLTAGE SENSOR
* Isolated with linearized optocoupler, such as LOC110 or HCNR200
* Use photovoltaic mode for better linearity (but lower bandwidth)
* Include trim pot(s) to compensate for transfer gain error (manufacturing error)
* Determine available op amp supply voltages before calculating resistor values!
